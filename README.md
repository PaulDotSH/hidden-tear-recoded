# Hidden Tear Recoded
This is a recode of the first open source ransomware called "Hidden-Tear"
Every "flaw" the original Hidden Tear had, is fixed in this recode

##### Features Include:
- Encrypts all files from the computer
- Tries to uncheck "read-only" file attribute
- Uses a ransom salt
- Sends encryption key, salt, computer and ip details to a backend (as JSON)
- Files are decryptable with the decryptor
- Uses a cryptographically secure random generator (files CANNOT be decrypted w/o the key and salt)
- Generates a thread for all drives (so encryption is faster)
- Much more
